## File I/O

- **input/**: Place files here that functions need to process (e.g., documents, data files)
- **output/**: Functions write their generated results here (e.g., reports, processed data)

## Skills

The `skills/` directory contains specialized capabilities with documentation and utilities.

### Available Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `pdf` | PDF manipulation - extract, create, merge, forms |
| `xlsx` | Spreadsheet creation, editing, formula recalculation |
| `docx` | Document creation, editing, tracked changes |
| `internal-comms` | Internal communications templates |
| `claude` | LLM for text generation, JSON extraction, image analysis |

Each skill has a `SKILL.md` with frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `license`), usage guides, and supporting files.

### Usage Patterns

**Library Pattern** - Run skill utilities directly:
```bash
uv run skills/xlsx/recalc.py output.xlsx
```

**Snippet Pattern** - Copy and adapt code from skill documentation:
- Read the SKILL.md for the relevant skill
- Find code examples matching your use case
- Adapt the pattern to your specific requirements

**Agentic Pattern** - Runtime skill invocation for complex tasks:
1. Read the skill's SKILL.md to understand capabilities
2. Follow the skill's workflow instructions
3. Use extended thinking (ultrathink) to plan thoroughly before implementation

## Python Environment

Use `uv` for all Python operations:

- Run scripts: `uv run script.py`
- Run with dependencies: `uv run --with package script.py`
- Run tests: `uv run pytest`
- Install dependencies: `uv sync`

## Function Pattern

```python
def function_name(data: InputModel) -> OutputModel:
    """
    Description.

    SOP Reference:
    > Cited text from sop.md
    """
    ...
```

## Naming

- Models: `PascalCase` (e.g., `Invoice`, `ValidationResult`)
- Functions: `snake_case` (e.g., `validate_invoice`)
- Fields: `snake_case` (e.g., `vendor_name`)
- Tests: `test_{function_name}.py`
